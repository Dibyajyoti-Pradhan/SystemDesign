## How to Use These Tables

1. **Identify** which topic you want to prepare for.
2. **Open the link** in the second column.
3. **Check the "Type"** to see if it’s more interview-focused or a deep engineering doc/paper.
4. **Focus Area** highlights **unique algorithms or concepts** (e.g., _MapReduce_, _Shortest path_, _Consistent Hashing_, _DHT_).
5. **Mark the "Studied" checkbox** (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`) in Markdown when you’re finished.

Most of these resources are **interview-ready** or provide strong real-world insights.  
Good luck with your preparation!
